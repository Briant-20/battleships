# BATTLESHIPS

This is a python command line application that allows the user to play a game of battleship against the computer.

## UX

I used an imported module to add colour to the terminal and make it more of an enjoyable experience.

### Colour Scheme

Blue is used in the terminal to indicate the players grid more clearly and red is used for the computers grid.
When a shot is missed a red X appears. Yellow is used for a placed ship and orange is used for a sunken ship.
